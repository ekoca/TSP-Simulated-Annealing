# TSP-Simulated-Annealing

Briefly, the simulated annealing is a probablistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem. The TSP is an optimization problem that seeks to find the shortest path passing through every city exactly once. In our example the TSP path is defined to start and end in the same city (so the path is a closed loop).

I implemented the simulated annealing in a Jupyter notebook and using it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook TSP-Simulated-Annealing.ipynb
~
